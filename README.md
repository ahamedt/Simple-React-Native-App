# Simple-React-Native-App


NOTE: This is a really barebones app and a lot of work needs to be done on the styling of the various components. I primarily used an iOS simulator when checking the functionality of the app. Also, there might be a bunch of commented out code that I was using for practice using the various tutorials/examples on the documentation , as a warning.

This is basically a simple react native app I made as part of the Dev Team in PennApps. It uses the newsapi.org News API to get a list of news articles based on how prominent (breaking news) they are. Users can tap/click on a headline and then it will take them to a detail page that will show them more info, such as the title, description, author, and url of the article. They can also go to an About page by swiping right. Will add an icon that indicates that.
